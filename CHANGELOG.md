# LpmSim — Release Notes

Versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/) on the deployable Web project (`src/LpmSim.Web/LpmSim.Web.csproj`):

- **MAJOR** — breaking schema/API changes that require operator action beyond running the listed migrations.
- **MINOR** — new features. Backward-compatible after running the listed migrations.
- **PATCH** — bug fixes / perf improvements only.

The version surfaces in the sidebar footer at runtime so operators can verify which build is in production.

## How to bump on each release

1. Edit `src/LpmSim.Web/LpmSim.Web.csproj`:
   ```xml
   <Version>X.Y.Z</Version>
   <AssemblyVersion>X.Y.Z.0</AssemblyVersion>
   <FileVersion>X.Y.Z.0</FileVersion>
   <InformationalVersion>X.Y.Z (Phase tag — short headline)</InformationalVersion>
   ```
2. Append a new section to this file under `## Unreleased` (move highlights into the new version's section).
3. Commit the bump as its own change (`chore: bump version to X.Y.Z`) so the release boundary is visible in `git log`.
4. Push.

## 1.14.3 — EOM Generate: more parallelism (2026-05-12)

### Performance
- **Two further EOM Generate perf wins on top of 1.13.2.** The page-open path was still spending real time inside `GetSavedAsync` (the saved-output fetch) — that work now runs concurrently with the readiness check and is itself parallelised internally.
  1. **`CheckAsync` and `GetSavedAsync` now run in parallel** on the Razor side via `Task.WhenAll`. They share no state, so the page-open wait is now `max(check, saved)` instead of `check + saved`.
  2. **The 3 independent queries inside `GetSavedAsync`** — DataSettings (store names), Divisions (division names), and LpmEomOutputs (saved rows) — also run in parallel, each with its own DbContext. Same pattern as `CheckAsync` from 1.13.2.

### Notes
- No SQL change, no schema change. Just reshapes the await-graph.
- All three GetSavedAsync callers (page open / View Saved button / post-Approve refresh) benefit.

---

## 1.14.2 — Variance Report: split Itemmaster lookup, fix 0-rows bug (2026-05-12)

### Fixed
- **Variance Report was returning 0 rows even when divisions with known variance were selected** (and the load was slow). Root cause: the inline `LEFT JOIN HODATA.dbo.Itemmaster` cross-database join was either confusing the SQL Server query planner OR silently filtering due to an implicit type mismatch between `Itemmaster.Itemcode` and `LPM_LocStock.ItemCode`. Moved the description lookup to a **separate C# round-trip** after the main variance query completes — same end result, much more reliable.
- Variance query now runs without any cross-DB join; the second query pulls only the descriptions for the distinct itemcodes that came back, with an explicit `CAST(Itemcode AS nvarchar(64))` on both sides of the IN-clause to neutralise any type-mismatch.
- Description lookup wrapped in a try/catch — if HODATA can't be reached, the page still shows variance numbers with blank descriptions instead of failing outright.

### Notes
- No schema or business-rule change. Same data, same totals, same ABS(Variance) DESC sort.
- Expect faster load times in addition to the bug fix — single-DB query plans are simpler than cross-DB ones.

---

## 1.14.1 — Variance Report: remove 10K row cap (2026-05-12)

### Changed
- **The 10,000-row safety cap on the Variance Report is removed.** Real-world prod data has more than 10K items contributing to the total variance, so the cap was hiding rows the planner needs to investigate. Result set is now unbounded — every (Item × Division) row where HO ≠ WH is returned.
- Removed the "Result capped at 10,000 rows" Snackbar warning and the metric-card subtitle hint.

### Notes
- `MudTablePager` still paginates the on-screen display (50 / 100 / 200 / 500 per page selectable).
- Excel export captures the full row set, not just the visible page.
- If a country's variance grows to very large row counts and the page feels slow, narrow via the Division multi-select or Itemcode contains-search before hitting Load.

---

## 1.14.0 — Reports → Variance Report (item-level) (2026-05-12)

### Added
- **New report: Variance Report** at `/lpm/reports/variance`, listed under the **Reports** sidebar group below "WH Stock Position". Item-by-item breakdown of the gap between Head Office stock and Warehouse stock — the same aggregation as WH Stock Position but rolled up at `ItemCode × Division` instead of Division alone, filtered to rows where **HO ≠ WH** so the planner can drill into the source of any division-level variance.
- **Columns:** Itemcode | Item Name | Division | HO Stock | WH Stock | Variance.
- **Filters:** Country (single), Division (multi-select), Season (All / Summer / Winter, default All), free-text Itemcode contains-search.
- **Excel export** with the same 6 columns + a TOTAL row.
- **Sorted** by `ABS(Variance) DESC` server-side so the biggest gaps surface first. Click any column header to re-sort in-memory.
- **Top 10,000 row safety cap** with a Snackbar warning if hit (variance-only filter keeps real-world cases well under).

### Data sources
- **HO Stock:** `racks.dbo.LPM_LocStock.SOH` where `storeid IN (...)` — UAE uses literal `'HODATA'`; other countries pull every storeid where `ExportWH='Y'` from `bfldata..DataSettings` (same logic as WH Stock Position).
- **WH Stock:** `whboxitems.Qty` applying the universal WH rule `ShopEligible <> 'E' AND PalletCategory NOT IN ('NON ELIGIBLE', 'ECOM')` — identical to WH Stock Position so the variance numbers reconcile across the two reports.
- **Item Name:** `HODATA.dbo.Itemmaster.description`. Single global source for all countries — if non-UAE has a different item-master DB later, the join can be swapped to a country-aware `[<DataName>].dbo.Itemmaster` via the same `WhBoxItemsSource`-style helper.
- **Division mapping:** `upc_subclass × subclassmaster` (LEFT JOIN; items with no mapping bucket as `(no division)` — same pattern as WH Stock Position).

### Notes
- Variance shown in red when negative (WH > HO — over-stocked vs HO).
- No schema changes. New service registered in DI as `VarianceReportService`.
- Variance ABS-sort and the 10K cap together mean even on a huge catalog the planner gets the most actionable rows first.

## 1.13.3 — Reports: rename WH/HO Stock → WH Stock Position (2026-05-12)

### Changed
- **Renamed the WH/HO Stock report to "WH Stock Position"** across the sidebar label, page title, page heading, Excel sheet name, Excel filename prefix (now `WhStockPosition_<Country>_<Timestamp>.xlsx`), and audit-log category (`Reports.WhStockPosition.Load`). Same page, same columns, same SQL — naming only.

### Notes
- **URL preserved at `/lpm/reports/wh-ho-stock`** so any existing bookmarks keep working. Change the route on request.
- Internal C# type names (`WhHoStockService`, `WhHoStockRow`, `WhHoStockFilter`, `WhHoSeason`) and the source file (`WhHoStock.razor`) were intentionally left untouched — they're developer-facing only and renaming would be a wider refactor.

---

## 1.13.2 — EOM perf + WH/HO Stock PalletCategory source (2026-05-12)

### Performance — EOM Generate page load
- **EOM Generate page-open time cut dramatically.** The "Re-check" / page-open path previously ran 9 sequential DB queries (8 readiness checks + the Division Summary stock breakdown). Two changes here:
  1. **Readiness queries now run in parallel.** The 8 independent checks (weights, store IDs, division count, planned inputs, WH stock count, store grades, volume groups, SKU max rules) fire concurrently via `Task.WhenAll`, each with its own DbContext (EF Core's DbContext isn't thread-safe). The single dependent query (sales-turns count) runs after Wave 1 finishes. Total time drops from ~sum-of-each to ~max-of-each — typically a 70–80% reduction on this path.
  2. **Division Summary stock breakdown is now lazy.** The heavy multi-CTE `GetDivisionStockBreakdownAsync` query (LPM_LocStock + whboxitems + upc_subclass + pallettype, FULL OUTER JOIN, no filters) is no longer run on page open. It fires the first time the planner clicks the **Division Summary** tab, and is cached per `(country, year, month)` scope so re-clicking the tab without changing filters is instant.

### Changed — WH/HO Stock report data source
- **PalletCategory is now read from `whboxitems.PalletCategory` directly** (was sourced via `INNER JOIN bfldata.dbo.pallettype pt` on `PalletType`). Two effects:
  - Boxes whose `PalletType` has no row in the pallettype master table are no longer silently dropped from the report — they now flow through and bucket by whatever category is stored on their own row.
  - One fewer cross-table dependency, slightly faster query.
- All 5 category-aware columns (WH Stock, Reserved Stock, Seasonal Stock, On Hold Stock, Eligible Stock) updated to use `w.PalletCategory`.

### Changed — WH/HO Stock universal eligibility rule
- **All `whboxitems`-sourced columns now apply the same rule:**
  - `ShopEligible <> 'E'` *(strict — excludes both 'E' and NULL, matching the planner's reference SSMS query exactly)*
  - **AND** `PalletCategory NOT IN ('NON ELIGIBLE', 'ECOM')`
- Reserved / Seasonal / On Hold / Eligible columns: the category clause is implicit (they match a specific category), so only the `ShopEligible` clause was tightened from `IS NULL OR <> 'E'` → strict `<> 'E'`.
- **LPM Stock and Non-LPM Stock** previously had NO restrictions (pure LPM-column check). Now they also apply the universal rule, so totals across columns reconcile and the planner's raw SSMS validation queries match the report.
- The column header on **WH Stock** displays the rule inline: "excl. NON ELIGIBLE, ECOM".

### Performance — WH/HO Stock report
- **WH side per-row `OUTER APPLY` replaced with `LEFT JOIN ItemDiv`** (the pre-aggregated CTE that already maps every itemcode → its division). The previous pattern ran a subquery against `upc_subclass × subclassmaster` for every row in `whboxitems` — N+1 against a multi-million-row table, which dominated load time. Single JOIN is index-friendly and runs once.
- Division filter logic consolidated to a single fragment (both CTEs now reference the same `id.Division` alias).

### Notes
- Same UI shape, same column meanings on Reserved / Seasonal / On Hold / Eligible. LPM / Non-LPM are now stricter — if you compared them against raw SSMS queries before today, expect smaller numbers now (rows with `ShopEligible='E'` or category in NON ELIGIBLE/ECOM no longer count).
- No schema changes, no migrations.

---

## 1.13.1 — Reports → Sidebar group + HO/WH totals reconcile (2026-05-12)

### Changed
- **Reports section in the sidebar** converted from a flat header + always-visible link to a collapsible `MudNavGroup`. The "Reports" parent row is shown by default with a chevron; sub-items (currently just "WH / HO Stock") only render when the planner expands the group. Matches the standard MudBlazor nav-group UX so future Reports entries don't crowd the sidebar.

### Fixed
- **WH / HO Stock report — HO Stock total was under-reporting** by the SOH of items that have no `upc_subclass → subclassmaster` mapping (~4% in UAE prod). The CTE used an `INNER JOIN ItemDiv`, which silently dropped any LPM_LocStock row whose ItemCode wasn't in the mapping table. Switched to `LEFT JOIN ItemDiv` and bucket unmapped items as a **"(no division)"** row at the bottom of the table. The page total now matches `SELECT SUM(SOH) FROM LPM_LocStock WHERE storeid IN (...)`.
- Same fix applied to the WH side: `OUTER APPLY (...) sm` now defaults `sm.Division` to `'(no division)'` via `ISNULL(...)`, and the previous `WHERE sm.Division IS NOT NULL` filter was removed, so WH-side totals also reconcile against a raw `SUM(Qty)`.
- When a specific Division (or set) is selected in the multi-select, the `'(no division)'` bucket is naturally excluded (no one filters for it explicitly).

### Notes
- Only the Reports section's sidebar markup changed. Existing flat sections (LPM Variables, Planning Config, Admin) stay as `<div class="lpm-nav-section">` headers.
- HO + WH SQL changes are isolated to `WhHoStockService.cs` — no schema changes, no impact on EOM Generate / SIM Generate / Warehouse Boxes queries.

---

## 1.13.0 — Reports → WH / HO Stock comparison report (2026-05-12)

### Added
- **New sidebar group "Reports"** (positioned between Warehouse Boxes and Planning Config) with the first item **WH / HO Stock**.
- **WH / HO Stock report page** at `/lpm/reports/wh-ho-stock`: one row per Division comparing Head Office stock vs Warehouse stock, with a per-category breakdown. 10 columns: Division, HO Stock, WH Stock, Variance, Reserved, Seasonal, On Hold, Eligible, Non-LPM, LPM. Bold TOTAL footer row. Variance turns red when negative.
- **Filters:** Country (single), Division (multi-select via the existing MultiSelectFilter component), Season (single — All / Summer / Winter, default All).
- **Country drives both sides of the report.** WH side uses the same UAE↔non-UAE source switch as the Warehouse Boxes page (`racks.dbo.whboxitems` vs `[<DataName>].dbo.WHBoxItemsExport`). HO side resolves storeids per country: UAE = literal `'HODATA'`; other countries = every `storeid` from `bfldata..DataSettings` where `country=<dataname>` and `ExportWH='Y'` (summed across multiple stores if present).
- **Excel export** mirrors the table including the TOTAL row.

### Column definitions
- **HO Stock** = Σ `LPM_LocStock.SOH` for the country's HO storeids, mapped to Division via upc_subclass → subclassmaster.
- **WH Stock** = Σ `whboxitems.Qty` where `UPPER(PalletCategory) <> 'NON ELIGIBLE'` AND purchased (`ShopEligible IS NULL OR <> 'E'`).
- **Variance** = `HO Stock − WH Stock`.
- **Reserved / Seasonal / On Hold / Eligible Stock** = Σ Qty where `UPPER(PalletCategory)` matches the category AND purchased.
- **Non-LPM / LPM Stock** = Σ Qty based purely on `whboxitems.LPM` (null/empty vs populated). No category or purchased restriction — per user spec.
- **Season filter** applies on both sides: WH side reads `whboxitems.Season` directly (`'W'` = Winter, else Summer); HO side derives from `UPCBarcodes.Itemtype`.

### Notes
- No schema changes, no migrations. New service registered in DI as `WhHoStockService`.
- Items with no subclass → division mapping are excluded (would land in an unrecognised-division bucket otherwise).
- "On Hold" and "Non Eligible" are compared case-insensitively via `UPPER(...)` so the SQL doesn't care whether the master tables stored the categories as `'On Hold'`, `'ON HOLD'`, or `'on hold'`.

---

## 1.12.0 — WH Boxes: TrnDate / CurrDate columns + date-range filter (2026-05-12)

### Added
- **Two new columns on the Warehouse Boxes detail view (Box Detail mode only):** `TrnDate` (date) and `CurrDate` (datetime), shown as the last two columns of the on-screen table and the Excel export. Sourced directly from `whboxitems.TrnDate` and `whboxitems.CurrDate` (UAE) or the equivalent columns on `[<DataName>].dbo.WHBoxItemsExport` (other countries) — both source tables expose them under the same names. Dates display as `yyyy-MM-dd` / `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`.
- **TrnDate range filter:** two new date pickers (`TrnDate From`, `TrnDate To`) on the filter bar, both empty by default. Inclusive on both ends. The pickers highlight when set (same visual cue as the other "non-default" filters on the page). CurrDate is **not** filterable — by design, only `TrnDate` is.

### Notes
- Summary modes (Division / Department / Brand) are unchanged — dates only surface on Box Detail.
- TrnDate values survive across country switches (the dates aren't country-scoped, so `OnCountryChanged` doesn't clear them).

---

## 1.11.0 — WH Boxes: multi-select filter dropdowns (2026-05-12)

### Added
- **Multi-select checkboxes on the Warehouse Boxes filter bar.** Eight previously single-value dropdowns are now multi-select via the existing `MultiSelectFilter` component (same UX as the SIM Generator's Division/Store filters): **Warehouse, Type Name, Pallet Category, LPM (month), Division, Department, Brand, ContNo**. Planners can now narrow a load to, say, three warehouses + two divisions in a single shot instead of running one load per combination.
- The three non-list filters stay single-select: **Country** (data source switch), **LPM Status** (enum), **Group By** (mode switch).

### Changed
- `WhBoxFilter` record (`LpmSim.Data/Warehouse/WarehouseQueryService.cs`): the eight list-type fields changed from `string?` to `IReadOnlyList<string>?`. `null`/empty list means "no filter" (same as before for missing values).
- SQL now uses parameterized `IN (@p0, @p1, …)` clauses built by a new `BuildInClause` helper. Empty lists produce no fragment, so an unfiltered field still generates zero predicates (no perf regression vs. the old `IS NULL OR =` pattern).
- Division/Department clauses route to either `HAVING` (in `GetBoxesAsync`, which aggregates with `MAX(scm.Division)`) or `WHERE` (in the three summary queries, which read `sm.Division` directly) via a single `BuildFilterClauses(filter, divDeptInHaving)` helper — keeps the routing in one place.
- `OnCountryChanged` now clears the country-scoped selections (Warehouse, LPM, ContNo, Brand) instead of nulling single fields, since those lists are repopulated from the new country's data.

### Notes
- The `MultiSelectFilter` component is unchanged — same component used elsewhere in the app, so the UX (search box + checkbox list + Done button + "N selected" trigger label) is identical.
- No schema changes. No data migration. Just deploy.

## 1.10.8 — Real fix for sidebar/table header color mismatch (2026-05-11)

### Fixed
- **Sidebar and table headers were rendering different shades of blue** despite 1.10.6/1.10.7 setting both `--lpm-drawer-bg` and `--lpm-table-head` to `#1e3a8a`. The CSS variable for the drawer was being overridden by MudBlazor's `PaletteLight.DrawerBackground` in `MainLayout.razor`, which still pointed at the old slate `#1e293b` — MudBlazor injects that as an inline style with higher specificity than the CSS variable rule.
- Updated `PaletteLight.DrawerBackground` from `#1e293b` → `#1e3a8a` so it agrees with the CSS variable. Sidebar and every table header now render the same `#1e3a8a` blue.

### Notes
- The same kind of MudTheme-vs-CSS-variable override could affect other tokens (`Surface`, `Background`, etc.) — but for now everything else is unchanged and looks consistent. If something else looks off later, check both `MainLayout.razor`'s palette AND `app.css`'s `:root` variables.

---

## 1.10.7 — Table headers: slate → blue (2026-05-11)

### Changed
- **All `MudTable` header strips** switched from slate (`#0f172a`) to **`#1e3a8a`** (Tailwind blue-900), matching the sidebar palette from 1.10.6. Affects every report grid in the app — EOM Generate (Store × Division, Store Summary, Division Summary), SIM Generate result tabs, SIM Reports (Item Details, Custom Report, Box Detail, etc.), Warehouse Boxes, Production Schedule, ADM, Audit Log, Weekly Sales Target Split, Store / Division Access, Store / Department Access, Warehouse Priorities, Grades, Volume Groups, SKU Max Rules, Users.
- Single CSS variable: `--lpm-table-head` at the top of `app.css`. All tables pick it up via the `.mud-table-head th` rule.

### Notes
- Text on the header stays white/light for contrast.
- No functional change. Pure color theme update.

---

## 1.10.6 — Sidebar palette: slate → blue (2026-05-11)

### Changed
- **Navigation drawer (sidebar) background** switched from slate (`#1e293b` / `#0f172a` — visually near-black) to a clearly blue palette: `#1e3a8a` (Tailwind blue-900) body, `#172554` (blue-950) for the header strip. Matches the existing `#2563eb` accent family.
- `--lpm-drawer-muted` brightened from `#94a3b8` → `#cbd5e1` so section labels (LPM VARIABLES, PLANNING CONFIG) stay readable on the lighter blue.

### Notes
- Only the sidebar's color tokens changed — main page content, tables, and forms keep their existing light theme.
- All 4 colors live as CSS variables at the top of `app.css`. If you want to tweak the exact shade later, edit `--lpm-drawer-bg` and `--lpm-drawer-bg-strong` — every navigation element picks them up automatically.

---

## 1.10.5 — Full MudBlazor v7 analyzer cleanup sweep (2026-05-11)

### Fixed
- **MUD0002 on `MudTextField` / `MudSelect` / `MudAutocomplete` / `MudDatePicker`** — 1.10.4 fixed only the `MudNumericField` instances; the deprecation also applies to other form-field components. Bulk-removed `Dense="true"` from every line where it appeared alongside `Margin="Margin.Dense"` across 18 Razor files (58 occurrences total). The legacy `Dense` parameter is deprecated on all form-field components in MudBlazor v7; `Margin="Margin.Dense"` (already present everywhere) is the v7 way to get compact spacing.
- **MUD0002 on `MudIconButton` `Title=`** in `WarehousePriorities.razor` and `WeeklySalesTargetSplit.razor` — renamed to lowercase `title=`. The analyzer was flagging `Title` (PascalCase) as a non-existent component parameter; lowercase `title` makes it explicit that this is the standard HTML `title` attribute (browser tooltip) being passed through.

### Notes
- `Dense="true"` is still valid (and still used) on non-form components: `MudTable`, `MudCheckBox`, `MudAlert`, `MudChip`. Those weren't flagged and were left alone.
- No functional change. Pure analyzer cleanup.

---

## 1.10.4 — MudBlazor v7 analyzer warnings cleanup (2026-05-11)

### Fixed
- **MUD0001** — `IsInitiallyExpanded` on `MudExpansionPanel` in `EomGenerate.razor` renamed to `Expanded` (MudBlazor v7 dropped the `IsInitiallyExpanded` naming).
- **MUD0002** — `Dense="true"` removed from 7 `MudNumericField` instances across `WarehousePriorities.razor`, `WarehousePriorityAddDialog.razor`, `LpmSimGenerate.razor` (2x), and `ProductionSchedule.razor` (3x). MudBlazor v7 form components only honour `Margin="Margin.Dense"` for compact spacing; the legacy `Dense` parameter is deprecated. `Margin="Margin.Dense"` was already present alongside `Dense="true"` in every flagged location, so removing `Dense="true"` is a net-zero visual change.

### Notes
- `Dense="true"` is still used (and still valid) on non-form components like `MudTable`, `MudCheckBox`, `MudAlert`, and `MudChip`. Those weren't flagged by the analyzer and were left alone — they have their own `Dense` parameter that's unrelated to the form-field deprecation.
- No functional change. Pure analyzer cleanup.

---

## 1.10.3 — Invert ShopEligible semantics on EOM Division Summary stock columns (2026-05-11)

### Fixed
- **WH Stock (Purchased)** and **WH Stock (Non-Purchased)** columns in the EOM Division Summary tab had their `ShopEligible` filters swapped. My 1.10.0 implementation followed the SIM allocator's convention (`ShopEligible = 'E'` → claimed/purchased), but the business labels work the opposite way:
  - **WH Stock (Purchased)** = boxes where `ShopEligible IS NULL OR <> 'E'` (cleared past the 'E' in-process state)
  - **WH Stock (Non-Purchased)** = boxes where `ShopEligible = 'E'` (still being processed)
  - **Eligible Stock** = `PalletCategory = 'ELIGIBLE' AND (ShopEligible IS NULL OR <> 'E')` (purchased subset of the ELIGIBLE category)
- The SIM allocator's filter on `ShopEligible <> 'E'` (= "available to allocate") is untouched and continues to mean what it always did. Only the Division Summary's display labels were reversed.

### Notes
- After the deploy lands, refresh the EOM Generate page — the larger number should now appear in "WH Stock (Purchased)" and the smaller in "WH Stock (Non-Purchased)" (the opposite of what 1.10.0–1.10.2 showed).

---

## 1.10.2 — Fix EOM Store × Division header layout (2026-05-11)

### Fixed
- **Headers on the EOM Generate Store × Division tab were rendering as vertical letter-stacks** (`W t A v g S o l d`, `S o l d Q t y R a n k`, etc.) because the table tried to fit all 18 columns into the viewport width via percentage column widths + forced `overflow-x: hidden`. At any reasonable screen size the column widths shrank below the width needed for a single character, so the browser wrapped each character onto its own line.

### Changed
- Replaced the percentage-based column widths on the Store × Division `MudTable` with **fixed pixel widths** sized to each header's actual text (e.g. 140px for Store/Division, 70px for the 3-line `Wt/Avg/Sold`-style headers, 100px for `Merch Need (Month)`-style headers). Total table width ≈ 1,580px.
- Updated `.lpm-eom-preview` CSS — removed the `width: 100% !important; max-width: 100% !important; overflow-x: hidden !important;` block. The container now scrolls horizontally when columns exceed viewport width. Heading text stays on its intended 1-3 lines.

### Notes
- Removing the Wk1-Wk4 columns in 1.10.1 alone wasn't enough — even at 14 columns the percentage layout was squashing headers. This fix would have made 1.10.1's column removal unnecessary, but the per-week columns can stay out of this tab regardless (the Division Summary's Wk1-4 columns from 1.9.0 are still removed; per-week values remain stored on `LPM_EOM_Output` and SIM Generate's Week dropdown still picks them).
- The Store Summary and Division Summary tabs use different `MudTable` widths and weren't affected by the squash; left them as-is.

---

## 1.10.1 — Hide Wk1..Wk4 columns on the Store × Division grid (2026-05-11)

### Changed
- Removed the 4 per-week Merch Need columns (`Wk1`, `Wk2`, `Wk3`, `Wk4`) from the EOM Generate **Store × Division** tab. Their addition in 1.9.0 was squashing every other column header to the point that "WtAvgSold" rendered vertically as `W t A v g S o l d`, etc.
- The per-week values are still computed by `EomCalculator`, still persisted to `LPM_EOM_Output.MerchNeedWeek1..4`, and still drive SIM Generate's `Week` dropdown for the allocator's cap. Only the visual columns on this one grid are gone.
- Excel export rows from this tab were not touched (the Wk1..4 columns were inline in the on-screen table only — Excel writer already excluded them).

---

## 1.10.0 — EOM Division Summary: HO + WH stock columns with Season filter (2026-05-11)

### Added
- **Four new columns on the EOM Generate → Division Summary tab:**
  - **HO Stock** — `SUM(SOH)` from `racks.dbo.LPM_LocStock` where `dataname='HODATA'`, mapped to division via `upc_subclass × subclassmaster × Division`. Season per item from `usa.dbo.upcbarcodes.Itemtype` (`'W'` → Winter, else Summer).
  - **WH Stock (Purchased)** — `SUM(whboxitems.Qty)` where `ShopEligible = 'E'` (boxes already claimed by a shop).
  - **WH Stock (Non-Purchased)** — `SUM(whboxitems.Qty)` where `ShopEligible IS NULL OR <> 'E'` (still available for SIM).
  - **Eligible Stock** — `SUM(whboxitems.Qty)` where `pallettype.PalletCategory = 'ELIGIBLE' AND ShopEligible = 'E'` (purchased subset of ELIGIBLE category — ready-to-ship eligible items).
- **Season filter** on the Division Summary tab (`All seasons / Summer / Winter`). Filter applies ONLY to the 4 new stock columns — `SOH`, `Target EOM`, `Target Sales`, `Merch Need` columns stay aggregated across both seasons (they're per-store-div and don't carry season).
- **`DivisionStockBreakdown` record** in `LpmSim.Data.Eom.EomModels` — one row per `(DivCode, Season)` returned by the new `EomCalculator.GetDivisionStockBreakdownAsync(country, ct)`.

### Changed
- **`EomCalculator`** gains `GetDivisionStockBreakdownAsync` — a single-batch SQL with three CTEs (`ItemDiv`, `ItemSeason`, `HOByDiv`) and a `FULL OUTER JOIN` between HO and WH rollups. Returns instantly when the underlying tables have indexes on `(itemcode)`. Country-aware via `WhBoxItemsSource.ResolveAsync` so it works for UAE (`racks.dbo.whboxitems`) and other countries (`[<DataName>].dbo.WHBoxItemsExport`).
- **`EomGenerate.razor`** refetches the stock breakdown after every Preview / Generate / View Saved / Approve so the values match the underlying tables at the moment the user lands on the tab. The cached dictionary is keyed by `(DivCode, Season)`.

### Notes
- The 4 new columns are NOT persisted to `LPM_EOM_Output` — they're computed on demand because `LPM_LocStock` and `whboxitems` change daily and a stored snapshot would be stale. No migration required for this feature.
- If the HO-stock query produces no row for a given division (item not in `upc_subclass` or no rows in `LPM_LocStock` for `dataname='HODATA'`), the column shows `0` for that division. Same for WH stocks when no boxes exist.

---

## 1.9.6 — Rule 4 join fix: drop upcbarcodes detour (2026-05-11)

### Fixed
- **Rule 4 (`usa.dbo.ExcludeItemsMFCS`) was hanging the entire exclusions phase for 15+ minutes** in 1.9.5. The old SQL went through `usa.dbo.upcbarcodes` (**18,016,969 rows**) to map `ItemCode → HSCode`, then filtered on `(HSCode, Shopname)` against `ExcludeItemsMFCS`. Join space: 15.7M `#SkuSnap` × 18M `upcbarcodes` = potentially ~282 trillion combinations, even though `ExcludeItemsMFCS` itself has only **198 rows**.

### Changed
- **Rule 4 now joins `ExcludeItemsMFCS` directly on `(Itemcode, Shopname)`**:
  ```sql
  INNER JOIN usa.dbo.ExcludeItemsMFCS e
          ON e.Itemcode = snap.ItemCode
         AND e.Shopname = snap.StoreID;
  ```
  No `upcbarcodes` detour. The schema of `ExcludeItemsMFCS` already exposes `Itemcode` as a column, so this is the natural join. Drops Rule 4 from "many minutes" to milliseconds.
- Reason text updated from `"Item HSCode x Shopname excluded in ExcludeItemsMFCS"` → `"Itemcode x Shopname excluded in ExcludeItemsMFCS"` to reflect the actual match shape.

### Notes
- The previous behaviour (HSCode-cascade — one row blocks every item sharing the same HSCode) is no longer applied. If that was the intended business semantic for some legacy reason, tell me and I'll revert + add a covering index on `upcbarcodes (itemcode) INCLUDE (HSCode)` to make the detour fast.
- Row counts confirmed from the user's diagnostic on the live DB. All other rules' join sizes are reasonable:
  - Rule 1: 15.7M × 430K (`ExcludeExport_Planning`)
  - Rule 2: 15.7M × 20M (`upc_subclass`) × 8K (`ExcludeSubclass`) — fast if `upc_subclass.itemcode` is indexed (worth checking if Rule 2 timing is high in the next build's StageDetail)
  - Rule 3: 15.7M × 540K (`RemoveItemsFromTransfer`)
  - Rule 4: 15.7M × **198** (`ExcludeItemsMFCS`) — was 15.7M × 18M before this fix
  - Rule 5: 15.7M × small (`DeptPriceMaxQty_MH4` 380 rows + `Hodata.SalesPrice` for items only)
  - Rule 6: 15.7M × small (`#Deact` only contains deactivated rows)
  - Rule 7: 15.7M × 1K (`subclassmaster`) × small (`LPM_StoreDeptAccess`)

## 1.9.5 — Real fix for #NewSnap persistence (2026-05-11)

### Fixed
- **`Invalid object name '#NewSnap'`** still firing on 1.9.4. Dropping `BEGIN TRAN` (1.9.4's attempted fix) didn't address the actual root cause: the main INSERT command used `ExecuteReaderAsync` + manual `using var rdr = ... ; await rdr.ReadAsync(ct);` to fetch the staged row count. Combined with DDL statements (`CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX`) and DML (`SELECT INTO`) producing implicit "X rows affected" info messages, the reader was leaving the connection in a state that occasionally triggered a session reset on the next `SqlCommand` execution — wiping all session-scoped temp tables including `#NewSnap`. The fact that the staging count `15,755,634 staged` reached C# correctly proved the SELECT INTO succeeded; the failure was purely in the *next* command's view of session state.

### Changed
- Main INSERT command now:
  - Uses `SET NOCOUNT ON` to suppress the DDL/DML row-count notifications
  - Uses `ExecuteScalarAsync` (not `ExecuteReaderAsync`) — which is what every other count-returning command in this file already uses, including the temp-tables-setup commands that have always worked. ExecuteScalar drains the result set immediately after reading the scalar and doesn't leave the connection in an ambiguous state.
  - No longer adds unused `@country`, `@y`, `@m`, `@now`, `@user` parameters (the staging SQL doesn't reference them — those columns get added during the delta-apply phase later).

### Notes
- After 1.9.5 deploys, re-run **Build SKU Max** for the active period. Expected StageDetail:
  ```
  Done · X items · ... · Insert ~60s · 15.7M staged ·
  Delta XXs · N ins · M upd · K del · J unchanged ·
  Y excluded · M price-capped · K div-deact · L dept-deact
  [R1...R7 ms] [· R5 SKIPPED (Hodata...) until permission granted]
  ```
- If `Invalid object name '#NewSnap'` reappears in this version's StageDetail, the next step is the bigger refactor: merge the staging SELECT INTO into the same SqlCommand as the existing `#Deact` populate. Let me know.

---

## 1.9.4 — Fix #NewSnap persistence between SqlCommands (2026-05-11)

### Fixed
- **`Invalid object name '#NewSnap'`** in the exclusions phase of `BuildItemSkuMaxAsync`. The staging temp table was being created via `SELECT INTO` inside a `BEGIN TRY / BEGIN TRAN / COMMIT` block, and SQL Server in some configurations doesn't reliably keep the temp table accessible past the COMMIT for subsequent `SqlCommand` executions on the same connection. The 12-minute build succeeded at staging (15.7M rows) but the next command couldn't see `#NewSnap`, so all 7 override rules and the delta-apply phase silently skipped.
- Dropped the transaction wrapper around the `SELECT INTO #NewSnap` + `CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX` pair — matches the pattern used by the other temp tables in this method (`#ItemWh`, `#Stores`, `#Rules`, `#Deact`), which have always been created outside any transaction and persist correctly across subsequent commands. Atomicity is not compromised: `SELECT INTO` is itself a single statement, and if it fails SqlClient throws naturally.

---

## 1.9.3 — SKU Max delta-apply via staging snapshot (2026-05-11)

### Changed
- **`BuildItemSkuMaxAsync` no longer rewrites every row on every build.** Replaced the legacy `DELETE-all + INSERT-all` against `dbo.LPM_SimItemSkuMax` with a **staging snapshot + delta MERGE** pattern:
  1. **Staging:** the rule-computed `(Store × Item × Season) → SKUMax` snapshot is built in a tempdb `#NewSnap` table (clustered on `StoreID, ItemCode, Season` — no nonclustered indexes, so writes are ~4× cheaper than the production table).
  2. **Overrides on staging:** the 7 override rules (1-7 plus the per-rule TRY/CATCH from 1.9.2) compute matches against `#NewSnap` and `UPDATE` its `SKUMax` in place — temp-to-temp updates are fast.
  3. **Delta apply** to `dbo.LPM_SimItemSkuMax`:
     - **Drop** the 3 nonclustered indexes (`IX_…_Lookup`, `IX_…_Item`, `IX_…_Div`)
     - **DELETE** rows in target for the period not in `#NewSnap` (scope-aware for LpmOnly/NonLpmOnly)
     - **UPDATE** rows whose `(SKUMax, WHBoxQty, VolumeGroup, DivCode)` differ from `#NewSnap` (option **b**: skip only when all four match)
     - **INSERT** rows in `#NewSnap` not yet in target
     - **Recreate** the 3 nonclustered indexes
- **Expected speedup:** first build for a period drops from ~12 min to ~5 min (index maintenance avoided). Rebuilds with no changes drop to ~30s (staging built but only a few rows actually written). Rebuilds with 1-5% changes typically land in 1-2 min.
- **StageDetail format** extended:
  ```
  Done · X items · ... · Insert Yms · 15,704,550 staged · Delta Zms ·
  N ins · M upd · K del · J unchanged · 1,234 excluded · 567 price-capped · ...
  ```
- **Safety:** when the exclusions phase fails catastrophically (`exclusionWarning` non-null), the delta-apply is SKIPPED — the prior build's data in `dbo.LPM_SimItemSkuMax` is preserved untouched. The StageDetail surfaces `Delta SKIPPED (exclusions failed — target unchanged)` so the planner sees what happened.
- **No data-model change** — no migration needed.

### Notes
- During the ~30s-2min "indexes-dropped" window, any concurrent reads of `dbo.LPM_SimItemSkuMax` for OTHER `(Country, Year, Month)` periods will fall back to the clustered index (still works, but slower than seeking through the dropped NCIs). If you have many concurrent same-instance read workloads against this table across periods, schedule SKU Max builds during quiet windows.
- The build is still serialised per `(Country, Year, Month)` by `SkuMaxBuildJobManager` — no risk of concurrent same-period builds racing on the temp tables.

---

## 1.9.2 — SKU Max per-rule TRY/CATCH isolation (2026-05-10)

### Fixed
- **One failing override rule no longer silently kills the other six.** The 7 SKU Max override rules previously ran inside a single `BEGIN TRY / BEGIN TRAN ... END TRY / BEGIN CATCH` SQL block, so a single failure (Hodata access denied on Rule 5, schema drift on Rule 4's `usa.dbo.upcbarcodes`, missing linked server, etc.) rolled the entire batch back — `LPM_SimItemSkuMaxExcluded` ended up empty and SIM Generate behaved as if no overrides existed. Symptom: empty audit table after a successful-looking 12-minute build with no per-rule timings in the StageDetail.

### Changed
- **Three-phase structure** in `BuildItemSkuMaxAsync`'s exclusions block:
  - **Phase 1 (no transaction):** Snapshot + temp table setup. Errors here are still fatal — the rest of the phase is meaningless without `#SkuSnap`.
  - **Phase 2 (`SET XACT_ABORT OFF`):** Each rule's `INSERT INTO #*Matches` runs in its own `BEGIN TRY / END TRY / BEGIN CATCH / END CATCH`. Failures store `ERROR_MESSAGE()` in `@r1Error..@r7Error` and let the next rule run on the same `#SkuSnap`. INSERT is atomic per statement in SQL Server, so a failed rule leaves zero rows in its match table — no risk of half-applied state.
  - **Phase 3 (`SET XACT_ABORT ON`, transactional):** Audit + UPDATE wrapped in a single transaction. The `DELETE FROM LPM_SimItemSkuMaxExcluded` is INSIDE the transaction now so a failed apply doesn't wipe the prior audit rows.
- **Build banner** now reports per-rule failures alongside the timings, e.g.:
  ```
  X excluded · Y price-capped · K div-deact · L dept-deact
   [R1 ms · R2 ms · R3 ms · R4 ms · R5 ms · R6 ms · R7 ms]
   · R5 SKIPPED (Login failed for user 'svc_planning_hub' on Hodata) | R4 SKIPPED (...)
  ```
  Failed rules are surfaced after the timing breakdown with the SQL `ERROR_MESSAGE()` truncated to 80 chars per rule.

---

## 1.9.1 — Migration 040 constraint-name fix (2026-05-10)

### Fixed
- **Migration 040** — `dbo.LPM_StoreDeptAccess` failed with `Msg 2714 — There is already an object named 'DF_LSDA_IsActive'`. Constraint names use a per-schema unique namespace and the `LSDA` prefix was already taken by `dbo.LPM_StoreDivAccess` (migration 022). Renamed all five constraints in 040 to use the `LSDeptA` prefix (`DF_LSDeptA_DeptPct`, `DF_LSDeptA_IsActive`, `DF_LSDeptA_CreateTS`, `CK_LSDeptA_DeptPct`). The migration is idempotent (`IF OBJECT_ID(...) IS NULL`) so re-running it after the fix creates the table cleanly. PK + UQ names (`PK_LPM_StoreDeptAccess`, `UQ_LPM_StoreDeptAccess`) were already unique and unchanged.
- Misleading `Migration 040 complete.` message — the final `PRINT` is in a separate batch (after `GO`) so it printed even when the `CREATE TABLE` batch failed. The fix doesn't change this — re-running on a clean DB now produces both `Created dbo.LPM_StoreDeptAccess` AND `Migration 040 complete.`

### Migrations to apply (in order)
`040` (re-run; the prior failed attempt didn't actually create the table, so the `IF OBJECT_ID IS NULL` guard will retry cleanly).

## 1.9.0 — Weekly Sales Target Split + per-week Merch Need + SKU Max Rules 5 & 7 (2026-05-10)

### Added
- **Weekly Sales Target Split admin page** (`/lpm/weekly-sales-target-split`, role-gated to Admin / PlanningManager) under **Planning Config**. Per-(Country × Year × Month × Division × Week) split percentage of the monthly Target Sales across 4 logical weeks. Each row shows Wk1 / Wk2 / Wk3 / Wk4 plus a live Total cell that turns red unless the row sums to 100%. **Save** is disabled until balanced. **Copy prev month** carries forward only the *custom* rows from the previous period — default rows stay default. **Reset to default** per row deletes the saved split and falls the row back to 20 / 20 / 25 / 35.
- **New table `dbo.LPM_WeeklySalesTargetSplit`** (migration **038**) with `(Country, Year1, Month1, DivCode, WeekNo)` UNIQUE; CHECK on WeekNo (1..4) and SplitPct (0..100). Row-level audit on save / delete via the existing `IActionLogger`.
- **Per-week Merch Need columns on `LPM_EOM_Output`** (migration **039**) — `MerchNeedWeek1`, `MerchNeedWeek2`, `MerchNeedWeek3`, `MerchNeedWeek4`. Filled by `EomCalculator` at Approve time using the new formula:
  ```
  MerchNeedWeekN = (TargetEOM − SOH) / 4 + (TargetSales × SplitPct[N] / 100)   for N = 1..4
  ```
  Falls back to the hard-coded default split **20 / 20 / 25 / 35** when no row exists for `(Country, Year, Month, DivCode)`. Legacy `MerchNeedWeek` column now mirrors `MerchNeedWeek1` so existing readers (ADM, ProductionScheduler, the Reports queries, the Custom Report engine) keep working without a wider refactor.
- **`LPMSIM_Batch.WeekNo`** (migration **039**) — tinyint NULL stamped from the new Week dropdown on SIM Generate; pre-migration batches stay NULL and display as Week 1.
- **SIM Generate — Week dropdown** (1..4, required, default 1) next to Run Date. The allocator's per-Store × Div weekly cap now reads `MerchNeedWeek{N}` per the chosen week (via a `CASE @weekNo` on the `LPM_EOM_Output` SELECT), not the legacy `MerchNeedWeek` column. Same EOM run can be re-allocated for a different week without re-running EOM.
- **EOM Generate — 4 new columns Wk1 / Wk2 / Wk3 / Wk4** in the per-store result table, each with its column total in the header. Tooltips spell out the formula and the default split.

### Changed
- `EomCalculator.CalculateAsync` loads the active splits for `(Country, Year, Month)` once at the top, then drives the per-week computation in the existing SOH-merge loop. Rounded `AwayFromZero` (matches existing convention).

### Added (continued) — SKU Max Build
- **New SKU Max Rule 5** — `usa.dbo.DeptPriceMaxQty_MH4` price-band cap. Looks up `(shopname, DivCode, Department, PriceF ≤ price ≤ PriceT)` per `(Store × Item)` row in the SKU Max snapshot and **REPLACES** `SKUMax = maxqty`. Department resolved from `Datareporting.dbo.subclassmaster`; price from latest `Hodata.dbo.SalesPrice.SalesRate` per item for `CostCode='001'` (MAX(TrnDate) wins). Rule writes audit rows to `LPM_SimItemSkuMaxExcluded` with `SourceTable = 'usa.dbo.DeptPriceMaxQty_MH4'` so admins can see which items got capped and to what value. Skips items missing a price; skips bands that don't cover the item's price; deactivated `(Store, Div)` rows are protected (excluded from the rule's input snapshot).
- **All 6 SKU Max override rules now write audit rows to `LPM_SimItemSkuMaxExcluded`** so admins can audit every override decision. Rule 6 (deactivation via `dbo.LPM_StoreDivAccess`) was previously applied silently at the main `INSERT`'s `CASE` clause — now it runs as a proper rule inside the exclusions transaction with `SourceTable = 'dbo.LPM_StoreDivAccess'` and a `PriorSKUMax` value (the rule-computed SKUMax that would have applied without the deactivation). The Pre-Generate deactivation sync (which catches deactivations made post-build) also writes audit rows now, with a distinct `Reason = 'Store-Div deactivated post-build (Pre-Generate sync)'`. The sync is idempotent — re-running it doesn't create duplicate audit rows.
- **New SKU Max Rule 7** — `dbo.LPM_StoreDeptAccess` (Store × Department deactivation). Finer-grained version of `LPM_StoreDivAccess` (which works at Division level). When a `(Country, Store, Div, Department)` tuple has `IsActive = 0`, every item in that Department under that (Store, Div) has its `SKUMax = 0`. Department resolved from `Datareporting.dbo.subclassmaster.Department` (same convention as Rule 5). Audit rows written with `SourceTable = 'dbo.LPM_StoreDeptAccess'`. The new `DeptPct` column on this table is reserved for a future EOM/SIM scaling rule and is currently NOT applied by the SKU Max build.
- **New admin page `/admin/store-dept-access`** under "Planning Config" (Admin / PlanningManager). Same UX as the existing Store / Division Access page — list / filter by country, deactivate / reactivate / edit / delete a (Store × Div × Department) row inline; multi-select Add dialog (Stores × DivDept pairs) with Active flag, DeptPct (default 100), and free-text Remarks. Audit-logged via `IActionLogger`.
- Build banner gains per-rule timings for Rules 5, 6, and 7 (`R5 Xms · R6 Yms · R7 Zms`) and the StageDetail now reports `N excluded · M price-capped · K div-deact · L dept-deact` with a per-rule timing breakdown.

### Fixed — SKU Max Build
- **`Invalid column name 'Shopname'` on Rule 2** (`usa.dbo.ExcludeSubclass`). The exclusion batch is wrapped in a single transaction, so Rule 2's failure rolled BACK rules 1, 3, 4 too — `LPM_SimItemSkuMaxExcluded` stayed empty across builds. Verified column on `ExcludeSubclass` is `Shop` (no `name` suffix); the join now references `es.Shop`. The other 3 tables (`ExcludeExport_Planning`, `RemoveItemsFromTransfer`, `ExcludeItemsMFCS`) use `ShopName` / `shopname` / `Shopname` respectively — all match SQL Server's case-insensitive comparison and were never broken.

### Migrations to apply (in order)
`038`, `039`, `040`.

### Notes
- After deploying, re-run **EOM Generate** for the active period so the new `MerchNeedWeek1..4` columns get populated. Until then they're NULL and the SIM allocator's `ISNULL(... , 0)` guards keep the run safe (cap of 0).
- Re-run **Build SKU Max** for the active period to pick up the Rule 5 price caps and the now-working Rules 1–4. The build banner's StageDetail will show `N excluded · M price-capped` instead of `exclusions SKIPPED (...)`.
- Tier 2 (making Reports / ADM / ProductionScheduler week-aware) is still pending — those readers continue to consume the legacy `MerchNeedWeek` column (= `Wk1` after re-Generate).

---

## 1.8.2 — Planning Hub rebrand + WH Boxes ContNo/LPM filters (2026-05-10)

### Changed
- **App rebrand: "LPM SIM" → "Planning Hub"** (UI labels only — no backend, DB, namespace, or route changes). Updated in 5 places: sidebar drawer brand title, sidebar drawer footer, home page H1 + `<PageTitle>`, Signed-out page text + reopen link, User Access page subtitle. Home page subtitle reworded from "Internal LPM simulator & data entry." to "Internal stock-allocation & merch-planning workspace." to reflect the broader scope.
- **Home page tiles redesigned** — removed `Division Max Entry` (superseded), `User Access` and `Audit Log` (admin-only, still reachable via side nav). Added three daily-workflow tiles: **EOM Generate**, **LPM SIM Generate**, **Warehouse Boxes** — visible to every signed-in user.
- **Side nav reorganized** — `Monthly Weights`, `Planned Inputs`, `Data Uploads` moved from "LPM Variables" section into "Planning Config". The "Planning Config" section header now sits outside the `<AuthorizeView Roles="Admin,PlanningManager">` so the three operational items remain visible to all signed-in users; the master-data pages (Store Grades, Volume Groups, SKU Max Rules, Store/Division Access, Warehouse Priorities) stay gated behind the Admin/PlanningManager roles.

### Added
- **Warehouse Boxes — ContNo column + filter.** New `ContNo` field on `WhBoxRow` and `WhBoxFilter`; `MAX(w.ContNo)` added to `GetBoxesAsync` SQL with the matching `(@contNo IS NULL OR w.ContNo = @contNo)` predicate; same `@contNo` filter wired into the rolled-up summary queries for consistency. New `WarehouseQueryService.GetContNosAsync()`. UI gets a new ContNo autocomplete dropdown on the filter row; ContNo column added to the Box-detail table and Excel export.
- **Warehouse Boxes — LPM month dropdown.** A `MudAutocomplete` populated from `WarehouseQueryService.GetLpmsAsync()` (already existed in the service; was previously not exposed on the UI). Distinct from the existing **LPM Status** select (Any / Has / No) — this one filters to a specific LPM month value (e.g. `May-26`).

### UI / Layout
- **Box-detail column order** — `ContNo` and `LPM` moved to the front of the row (after Warehouse) so each line reads "container → pallet → box". On screen and in Excel, the new order is: `Country | Warehouse | ContNo | LPM | Pallet No | Box No | Pallet Type | Type Name | Pallet Category | Division | Department | Brand | Rack | Purchased | Qty`.

---

## 1.8.1 — Allocation Result × Warehouse + WH Box filter rename (2026-05-10)

### Added
- **Allocation Result table redesigned** on the SIM Generate result preview. Old shape (LPM/Non-LPM × Lines/Stores/Boxes/Qty) replaced with one row per `(Kind × Warehouse)` showing **SKU Count** (distinct itemcodes), **Boxes** (distinct), **Box Qty** (warehouse-side stock), and **Output SIM Qty** (allocated). New `SourceWarehouseRow` record + `GetSourceWarehouseBreakdownAsync` query (pre-aggregated CTEs against `racks.dbo.whboxitems` — no per-row subqueries).

### Changed
- **Warehouse Boxes page — checkbox renamed and inverted.** "Show Non-Purchased" (default ON, applied the `<> 'E'` filter) → **"Include non-Purchased Boxes"** (default OFF, drops the `<> 'E'` filter when ticked). Same semantics as the existing SIM Generate "Include Non-Purchased Boxes" flag. Field renamed `WhBoxFilter.NonPurchasedOnly` → `IncludeNonPurchased`. Default behaviour unchanged.

### Fixed
- **Warehouse Boxes header alignment.** Totals in the `.lpm-th-total` spans were drifting above adjacent column headers when the row-count cell (single-line content) was shorter than its multi-line neighbours. Added `lpm-wh-table` class to all four MudTables on the page; CSS forces `vertical-align: top` and `nowrap + ellipsis` on totals so every header column lines up cleanly.

---

## 1.8.0 — Phase H — Custom Report + Warehouse Priorities + ADM (2026-05-09)

### Added
- **Custom Report tab** on SIM Generate — multi-select `Group By` + `Columns`, dynamic SQL builder via field whitelist (injection-safe), Excel export.
- **Warehouse Priorities** admin page (`/admin/warehouse-priorities`) backed by new `dbo.LPM_WarehousePriority` table (migration **037**). Lower number = higher priority; missing rows fall to 9999 (sort last). Box read-order in `ReadBoxesAsync` joins to this table.
- **ADM (Allocation Distribution Model)** page — separate menu, new `LPMSIM_ADM_Run` + `LPMSIM_ADM_BoxAlloc` tables (migration **033**).
- **Production Schedule** page — new `LPMSIM_ProductionSchedule` table (migration **029**).
- **Background SKU Max build** (`SkuMaxBuildJobManager`) with three scopes (All / LPM-only / Non-LPM-only). Per-scope DELETE preserves rows for items in the other scope. Cancel button + force-close on cancel for snappy abort. Build-history persisted in `LPM_SimItemSkuMaxBuild` (migration **032**).
- **SKU Max exclusion rules** — four source tables (`usa.dbo.ExcludeExport_Planning`, `ExcludeSubclass`, `bfldata.dbo.RemoveItemsFromTransfer`, `usa.dbo.ExcludeItemsMFCS`). Run as a separate batch so a schema mismatch on any source is non-fatal — the snapshot rebuild still commits with `exclusions SKIPPED` in the StageDetail (migration **034**).
- **Pre-Generate sync of `LPM_StoreDivAccess` deactivations** into the SKU Max snapshot — deactivation changes take effect on next Generate without a SKU Max rebuild.
- **`PriorityRank` (Store × Div)** column on Summary, Item Details, and Custom Report — surfaces the rank that drives `EqualPerStore` (primary) and `EqualFillRate` (tiebreak) sort.
- **EOM Balance ≤ 0 gate** in allocator — over-stocked `(Store, Div)` pairs are skipped with `SKIP_EOM_BALANCE` trace tag.
- **`MultiSelectFilter` reusable component** — search box + checkbox list in a popover; replaces substring-matching `MudAutocomplete` filters that incorrectly matched "Menswear" inside "Womenswear".
- **Item Details** UI: `BoxNo` removed, `Qty → BoxQty`, new `LPM` chip column, `LPM Qty → SIM Qty`, **Rank** column.
- Multiple-batches-per-period support — drop `UQ_LPMSIM_Batch_CountryRunDate` (migration **036**), Generate keeps Approved batches and stamps a new Draft alongside.
- Pallet Categories multi-select on SIM Generate (replaces the "Include All LPM Boxes" checkbox).
- LPM Months multi-select on SIM Generate.
- Warehouse Boxes report enhancements (Division / Department / Brand / Rack / Purchased columns, group-by modes, Excel export).

### Changed
- **Default `FillStrategy` = Ranking + RR** (was Equal fill %). The Equal fill % radio still selectable.
- **Item Details query rewritten** — pre-aggregated CTEs (`BoxAttrs`, `BoxTotals`) replace per-row correlated subqueries against `racks.dbo.whboxitems`. Multi-second → sub-second on a 116K-row batch.
- **`SKUMax` column on Item Details** now reads from `LPM_SimItemSkuMax` (per-Store × Item) rather than `LPM_EOM_Output.SKUMax` (per-Store × Div) — the column total no longer reads as 0 when EOM rows are missing.
- **`ItemDiv` resolution on Item Details** uses LocStock-first / upc_subclass fallback (matches the allocator). Pre-fix the report was upc_subclass-only and silently dropped lines for items not in upc_subclass.
- **`FillStrategy` widened** to `varchar(40)` (migration **035**) so the "(SKU Max only)" tag fits.
- Engine column-name comment + audit `Reason` strings updated for `usa.dbo` schema's `Shopname` convention.
- StoreID prefix added to every Store cell — fixes the "blank stores" rendering when `DataSettings.PBFullname` is null.
- Multi-select with checkboxes (search + tick) on Filter Store / Filter Division — exact match, not substring.

### Migrations to apply (in order)
`024`, `025`, `026`, `027`, `028`, `029`, `030`, `031`, `032`, `033`, `034`, `035`, `036`, `037`.

## 1.7.0 — Phase G — SQL-side SKU Max build (initial import, 2026-04-22)

Initial baseline imported into the new repo. Phase G moved the per-period SKU Max build entirely into a SQL `INSERT … SELECT` driven by temp tables — about 5–10× faster than the previous C# bulk-copy round-trip.
